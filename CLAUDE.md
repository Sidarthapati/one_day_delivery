# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

An in-house one-day intercity parcel delivery platform (B2B + B2C) across 5 Indian cities. Full logistics chain: pickup DA → hub sortation → airline flight → hub sortation → delivery DA. No third-party last-mile carriers in v1.

Stack: **Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.2**, **Maven multi-module**, **PostgreSQL**, **Kafka**. Frontend (React) comes later.

Design docs in `docs/`: `PRD-ONE-DAY-DELIVERY.md`, `MODULES.md`, `PRD-DISCOVERY-QUESTIONNAIRE.md`, `M3-GRID-DESIGN.md`, `M3-ALGORITHM-DISCUSSION.md`, `M3-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`.

## Build Commands

```bash
mvn clean install          # build all modules
mvn clean install -pl auth # build a single module
mvn test -pl orders        # test a single module
```

The only runnable artifact is `app/` — it assembles all modules into one Spring Boot JAR.

## Project Structure

Maven multi-module monolith. Each directory is a Maven submodule with its own `pom.xml`:

| Directory | Module | Depends on |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| `common` | Shared infra: `BaseEntity`, Kafka topics, shared event POJOs | — |
| `auth` | M1 — Identity, JWT, 10 actor roles | common |
| `pricing` | M2 — Quote computation (volumetric weight, city-pair, B2B/B2C) | common |
| `grid` | M3 — Rectangular tile grid; DA rebalancing; nightly replan | common |
| `barcode` | M8 — Parcel ID generation; append-only scan ledger | common |
| `orders` | M4 — Shipment state machine (BOOKED → DELIVERED/RTO) | common, auth, pricing, grid, barcode |
| `dispatch` | M5 — DA priority queue; cron-meeting feasibility (hard constraint) | common, grid, orders |
| `routing` | M6 — Nightly van route plan over grid graph | common, grid |
| `hub` | M7 — Inbound dock, stand assignment, bag creation, manifests | common, barcode, orders |
| `airline` | M9 — Flight schedule sync, hub-level assignment, GHA API | common, hub, orders |
| `sla` | M10 — Per-leg SLA state (GREEN/AMBER/RED); Kafka consumer | common, orders, barcode |
| `exceptions` | M11 — Failure capture, call center queue, RTO workflow | common, orders, sla |
| `app` | Entry point only — wires all beans, no business logic | all modules |

**Within each module**, follow this package layout:
```
com.oneday.{module}/
  api/         REST controllers
  service/     Business logic (keep impl package-private; expose only the interface)
  domain/      JPA entities
  repository/  Spring Data repos
  events/      Kafka producers and consumers
  dto/         Request/response objects
```

## Key Design Invariants

- **Append-only audit trail:** scans, manifests, role changes, and grid/route overrides are never mutated.
- **Nightly stability:** grids (M3) and van routes (M6) replan once nightly. Intraday changes need station manager approval.
- **70/30 demand weighting:** grid sizing and flight assignment use 70% historical / 30% current demand.
- **Cron-meeting is a hard constraint:** M5 must confirm a parcel can reach the hub cron before airline cutoff — no assignment otherwise.
- **DA utilisation ~70%:** 70% of the shift is order-engaged time (travel to each pickup + service at each pickup); 30% is idle/unproductive (hub wait, repositioning without an order). This is the cost floor in M3, M5, M6 — don't optimise purely for speed.
- **Cross-module imports:** only import another module's public service interface, never its internal classes.

## Implementation Status

| Module | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `common` | `BaseEntity` + `MutableBaseEntity` (@MappedSuperclass, UUID id + audit timestamps) — done |
| `grid` (M3) | **Phases 1–8 done.** Phase 9 (integration tests) is next. See `docs/M3/M3-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` for full phase plan. |
| `orders` (M4) | PRs 1–8 merged + architect-review fixes applied. Flyway migrations (V4_1–V4_10), JPA entities, Spring Data repositories, service layer (ShipmentStateMachine, TransitionRegistry, TransitionContext, CustomerVisibleStateMapper), and idempotency infrastructure (IdempotencyFilter, IdempotencyKeyPurgeJob, IdempotencyProperties, V4_10 fingerprint migration) — all done. REST API booking endpoints (PR9) not yet started. |
| All others | Not started |

## Local Dev Setup

- **PostgreSQL 16** installed via Homebrew. Start: `brew services start postgresql@16`
- **DB:** `oneday`, **user:** `oneday`, **password:** `secret`, **port:** 5432
- **GUI:** TablePlus (`/Applications/TablePlus.app`) — connect to localhost:5432
- `grid/src/main/resources/application.yml` already has `spring.datasource` pointing at the local DB
- Migrations run automatically via Flyway on app startup; to run manually: `psql -U oneday -d oneday -f <migration.sql>`

## Open Questions (block implementation of specific modules)

See `docs/PRD-ONE-DAY-DELIVERY.md §20` for full list. Key blockers:
- Grid vertex/tile rules (partially resolved — see `M3-GRID-DESIGN.md`): G1 (cron-vertex meaning), G2 (UTM vs WGS84), G4 (approval SLA) still open; G3 (1 DA : N tiles and M DAs : 1 tile) resolved in design doc
- DA assignment objective function (blocks M5) — A1–A4
- Barcode standard + hub overload tactics (blocks M7, M8) — H1–H3
- Airline AWB issuer + handover SLA in minutes (blocks M9) — L1–L3
- RTO attempt count + DA penalty workflow (blocks M11) — F1–F3
